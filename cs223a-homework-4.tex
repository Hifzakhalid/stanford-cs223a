The linear Jacobian is derivated from the vector position. To be noticed the following trigonometric properties:

\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial s_{12}}{\partial \theta_{1}} =
    c_{1}c_{2}-s_{1}s_{2} = c_{12}
\end{equation}

And:

\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial c_{12}}{\partial \theta_{1}} =
    -s_{1}c_{2}-c_{1}s_{2} = -s_{12}
\end{equation}

The linear Jacobian, calculated from the partial derivates, is:

\begin{equation}
  \prescript{0}{}J_{V} = \begin{bmatrix}
    -\sqrt{2}s_{12}c_{3}-c_{12}(s_{3}-1)-s_{1} & -\sqrt{2}s_{12}c_{3}-c_{12}(s_{3}-1) & -\sqrt{2}c_{12}s_{3}-s_{12}c_{3} & 0 \\
    \sqrt{2}c_{12}c_{3}-s_{12}(s_{3}-1)+c_{1}  & \sqrt{2}c_{12}c_{3}-s_{12}(s_{3}-1)  & -\sqrt{2}s_{12}s_{3}+c_{12}s_{3} & 0 \\
    0                                          & 0                                    & c_{3}                            & 0 \\
                         \end{bmatrix}    
\end{equation}

For $q=[0, 90^{\circ}, -90^{\circ}, 0]^{T}$, the Jacobian is the composition of the linear calculated above and the angular:

\begin{equation}
  \prescript{0}{}J = \begin{bmatrix}
    0 & 0 & 0                  & 0 \\
    3 & 2 & \sqrt{2}           & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0                  & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} & \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \\
    0 & 0 & 0                  & 0 \\
    1 & 1 & \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} & \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \\
                         \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

A general force is a vector describing the force and the torque applied at a given point. It is similar to the general coordinates of a solid body. The general force vector is specific to a robot link and can be translated using the rotation part of the Jacobian. This is not very obvious, just consider that the force intensity is not modified by the frame translation.

\begin{equation}
  \prescript{0}{}F = \begin{bmatrix}
    \prescript{0}{4}R & 0 \\
    0 & \prescript{0}{4}R \\
                     \end{bmatrix}
  \prescript{4}{}F
\end{equation}

The rotation matrix has to be calculated for the given position:

\begin{equation}
  \prescript{0}{4}R = \begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}  & 0 & \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \\
    0                   & 1 & 0                  \\
    -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} & 0 & \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \\
                      \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

So in frame $\{0\}$, the general force is described by $\begin{bmatrix}0, 6, 0, 10.607, 0, 0.707\end{bmatrix}^{T}$.

The torque required to handle this force is given by:

\begin{equation}
  \tau = J^{T}F
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  J^{T} = \begin{bmatrix}
    0 & 3        & 0 & 0                  & 0 & 1                  \\
    0 & 2        & 0 & 0                  & 0 & 1                  \\
    0 & \sqrt{2} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
    0 & 0        & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
          \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

Applied to the general force determine in frame $\{0\}$, that gives $\begin{bmatrix}18.707, 12.707, 16.485\end{bmatrix}^{T}$.

\question

\begin{parts}

\part

The workspace of this manipulator is a cylinder of diameter $L_{2}+L_{3}$, excluding the inner cylinder of diameter $L_{3}-L_{2}$. No specific dimensions are given for the height. 

\part

The dexterous workspace is the space with all degrees of freedom. This manipulator has no such workspace. 

\part

As the prismatic joints are moving along the same axis, there are infinite solutions. If one is actuated up, the other is actuated down for the same position.

\part

Without the first prismatic joint, there is only one degree of freedom for the height. That means there are two solutions, as any position in the plan can be reached by two revolute joint position.

\part

In this last configuration, there is only one position for the height and infinite solutions for the position in the plan.
