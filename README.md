Stanford CS223A assignments from SEE (Stanford Engineering Everywhere)

I have followed the [CS223A online course from SEE][see-cs223a]. This repository contains the homework I have done during this period.

They are all written in LaTeX. GitHub accommodates very well LaTeX files. I had to [learn this markup language][blog-latex] during the first homework. Consider 5 hours to become efficient. You can also save time by reading my [blog posts about LaTeX][latex-tag] to get what is required for witting homework in LaTeX. The investment definitively worth it. The LaTeX way of writing equation is wide spread.

You can follow the [tag CS223A][cs223a-tag] on my blog for a full review of my progress and my feedback on the course itself.
