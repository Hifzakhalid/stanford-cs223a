Exercise 1.

Short reminder of the naming conventions:

\begin{equation}
  \prescript{A}{}{P} = \prescript{A}{B}{R} \prescript{B}{}{P}
\end{equation}

The problem described is a combination of 2 rotations in two different frames:

\begin{equation}
  \prescript{A}{B}{R} = \prescript{A}{A'}{R} \prescript{A'}{B}{R} = R_{y}(\theta) R_{z}(\phi)
\end{equation}

The first rotation can be described as a basic rotation matrix:

\begin{equation}
  \prescript{A}{A'}{R} = R_{y}(\theta) = \begin{bmatrix}
                                            c\theta  & 0 & s\theta \\
                                            0        & 1 & 0        \\
                                            -s\theta & 0 & c\theta
                                          \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

The second rotation is also a basic rotation matrix:

\begin{equation}
  \prescript{A'}{B}{R} = R_{z}(\phi) = \begin{bmatrix}
                                          c\phi & -s\phi & 0 \\
                                          s\phi & c\phi  & 0 \\
                                          0     & 0      & 1
                                        \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

So the composition of both rotations gives:

\begin{equation}
  \prescript{A}{B}{R} = \begin{bmatrix}
                          c\theta c\phi  & -c\theta s\phi & s\theta \\
                          s\phi          & c\phi          & 0 \\
                          -s\theta c\phi & -s\theta s\phi & c\theta
                        \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

This exercise is the case of rotation composition using different reference frames. The reference of the frame is required in the notations.

Exercise 2.

The first rotation gives:

\begin{equation}
  \prescript{A}{}{P'} = R_{z}(\phi) \prescript{A}{}{P}
\end{equation}

The second rotation is then applied to the first one:

\begin{equation}
  \prescript{A}{}{P''} = R_{y}(\theta) \prescript{A}{}{P'} = R_{y}(\theta) R_{z}(\phi) \prescript{A}{}{P}
\end{equation}

So:

\begin{equation}
  R(\phi, \theta) = R_{y}(\theta) R_{z}(\phi)
\end{equation}

The correction concludes that therefore this is the same matrix than the one from the previous exercise. It took me time to spot what I did not found obvious in this conclusion. That comes from the reference frame which has been omitted. Ii is true because:

\begin{equation}
  \prescript{A'}{}{R_{y}(\theta)} = \prescript{A}{}{R_{y}(\theta)}  
\end{equation}

And this last equation is true because ${A}$ and ${A'}$ share the $y$ axis.
